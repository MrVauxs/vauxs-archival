Previously Vauxs Chat Enhancements, this module is just the archives feature.

Why did I make the module much smaller in scope? For sake of finishing it and preserving my sanity.

## TODO:

- [x] Chat Archives - Create archives of the chat log and browse them in-game.
  - [ ] Quick Search - Be able to search the archives for specific messages.
  - [ ] Quick Archive - Replace the "Export Chat Log" button with a Vauxs' Archives button.
  - [ ] Edit Archive - Edit the name, description, and date of a given archive.
  - [x] Render 1:1 - The archive is an accurate recreation of how the chatlog was rendered at the time.
  - [x] Foundry to Discord integration - ~~Allow the messages to not be deleted on Discord when archiving them.~~ If your message count is higher than 10, FtD won't delete the messages anyway.
  - [x] DFCE integration - Be able to read DFCE archives. Likely to be achieved by manually pointing at the JSON file.

## Maybe:
- [ ] 'Cron' Archive - Archive (and opt. prune) the chat automatically once the oldest message passes the threshold of ex. a week.
- [ ] Rolls Summary - See the rolls of a given archive summarized, per user.

## Preview (0.4.0)

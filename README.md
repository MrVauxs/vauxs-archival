# Vauxs' Archives

Previously Vauxs Chat Enhancements, this module is just the archival feature.

Why did I make the module much smaller in scope? For sake of finishing it and preserving my sanity.

## Features

- [ ] Chat Archival - Create archives of the chat log and browse them in-game.
  - [ ] Quick Search - Be able to search the archives for specific messages.
  - [ ] Foundry to Discord integration - Allow the messages to not be deleted on Discord when archiving them.
  - [ ] DFCE integration - Be able to read DFCE archives. Likely to be achieved by manually pointing at the JSON file.
